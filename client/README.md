  # Description
 Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

Looking for your next big adventure? Love touring around the country enjoying the great outdoors or finding a park near you? Look no further. Our website, National Park Explorer, allows you to search for your next national park destination. It also allows you to view comments posted to decide if that park is right for you. You can even leave a review of your own trip to advise others.

Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

We wanted to cater to those looking for a national park to go to on their next adventure! Our website allows users to look up parks and comments relating to those parks to decide if it is the right trip for them. 

Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

Technologies we used included react, javascript, html, css, bootstrap, national parks api, gql, sql, sequelize, and heroku.

Roles were broken down as follows:

Brady: Project Manager, worked on backend functionality, setting up apollo client on backend to view schemas, assisted with API pull on front end for park data.

Stuart: Worked on react / bootstrap implementation - debugging - team assistance - redirection / endpoints.

Eric: 

Elizabeth: Worked on front end along with Stuart, created the pages in the client side, general layout, and wrote this readme.

Challenges we faced included working with react and following time constraints due to all of our react related setbacks.

Successes we had included working and collaborating well as a team and deploying app. 

Demo: Show your stuff!

Directions for Future Development

Directions for the future would be to create a filter by location function and to show the distance from the user's computer to the national park. We would also like to add a share to social media option so other's could post their linked reviews to facebook, instagram, pinterest, etc.
