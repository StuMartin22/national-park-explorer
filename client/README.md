  # Description
 Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application



Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

We wanted to cater to those looking for a national park to go to on their next adventure! Our website allows users to look up parks and comments relating to those parks to decide if it is the right trip for them. 

Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

Technologies we used included react, javascript, html, css, bootstrap, national parks api, gql, sql, sequelize, and heroku.

Roles were broken down as follows:

Brady: Project Manager

Stuart: Worked on react / bootstrap implementation - debugging - team assistance - redirection / endpoints.

Eric:

Elizabeth: Worked on front end along with Stuart, created the pages in the client side, general layout, and wrote this readme.

Challanges we faced included working with react and following time constraints due to all of our react related setbacks.

Successes we had included working and collaborating well as a team and deploying app. 

Demo: Show your stuff!

Directions for Future Development

Directions for the future would be to sort the user input recipe cards alphabetically and adding a search function. Another idea would be to link pinterest for an easy to save function for recipe ideas.
